JS Game Engine
===================

This is a very basic HTML5 canvas game engine I'm creating mainly as a learning process to wrap my head around the game loop/physics. At the moment, it's extremely bare bones and just allows you to draw a bouncing ball on the page. Here is the code used to create the demo:

    var canvas = document.getElementById('the-canvas');
    var scene = new GameEngineScene(500,500, canvas);

    scene.add_object({
      template: 'ball',
      radius  : 10,
      x       : 100,
      y       : 100
    });

    scene.run();
